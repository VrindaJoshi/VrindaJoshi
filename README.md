### Hi!
My name is Vrinda, and I love swimming, playing the trumpet, and math!

I also love to code! Some cool things I've created include...
- âœ¨ A Punnet Square App that calculated the genotypes and phenotypes of children (Inspired by my budding interest in Biology!)
- âœ¨ A Computer Automated Instructional software that teaches you all about OOP (Object-Oriented Programming!)
- âœ¨ My personal website
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about all the cool things you can do in JavaScript.
