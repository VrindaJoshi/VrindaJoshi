### Hi, I'm @VrindaJoshi!
I love swimming, playing the trumpet, and math!

I also love to code! Some cool things I've created include...
âœ¨ <a class = "current-link" href="https://github.com/VrindaJoshi/punnetsquare">a punnet square application</a> which calculates the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring
âœ¨ <a class = "current-link" href="https://github.com/VrindaJoshi/gr11culminating">a computer automated instructional software</a> that teaches you all about OOP (Object-Oriented Programming!)
âœ¨ <a class = "current-link" href="https://VrindaJoshi.github.io">my personal website</a>
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about all the cool things you can do in JavaScript.
